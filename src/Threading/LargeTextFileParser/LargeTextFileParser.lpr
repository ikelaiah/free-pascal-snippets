program LargeTextFileParser;

{
 Description

 This program is a simple example of parsing of a text file using N threads.
 The code reads and divides the text file into chunks and assigns these chunks
 to different threads, ensuring that no chunk splits a paragraph or sentence.

 Workflow

 1. File Reading      - Read the file in 12MB chunks.
 2. Data Integrity    - Ensure chunks do not split paragraphs or sentences by
                        adjusting the file pointer based on the last newline
                        character.
 3. Thread Management - Use up to N threads to process chunks in parallel.
 4. Display Output    - Print the size of each chunk and the first line of each chunk.

   nearest newline, without breaking a paragraph or sentence.

          Explanation
          ---

          Let's say we have a buffer size of 1000 characters, and the last
          newline character is found at index 950.
          The buffer contains 50 characters after the last newline.

          bufferSize  = 1000
          lastNewLine = 950
          bufferSize - lastNewLine - 1 = 1000 - 950 - 1 = 49
          Assuming SizeOf(Char) = 1 (for simplicity),

          ```pascal
          fStream.Position := fStream.Position - 49 * SizeOf(Char);
          ```

          This means the file position is moved back by 49 bytes, so the next
          read operation will start at the 951st character in the buffer,
          which is the character immediately following the last newline.
          This ensures that no line is split between two chunks and maintains
          the integrity of the data being processed.
        }
        fStream.Position := fStream.Position - (bufferSize - lastNewLine - 1) * SizeOf(char);

        // Increment active thread counter
        Inc(activeThreads);

        // If max threads are active, wait for them to finish
        if activeThreads = MAX_THREADS then
        begin
          for index := 0 to MAX_THREADS - 1 do
          begin
            threadList[index].WaitFor;
          end;
          activeThreads := 0;
        end;
      end; // -- End of the `while fStream.Position < fStream.Size do` loop.

      // Wait for any remaining threads to complete
      for index := 0 to activeThreads - 1 do
      begin
        threadList[index].WaitFor;
      end;

    finally
      fStream.Free; // Clean up the file stream
    end;
  end;

  // Check if the input file exists
  if not FileExists(ParamStr(1)) then

    WriteLn('File not found. Does ', ParamStr(1), ' exist?');
